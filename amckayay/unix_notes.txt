# Permissions
reading, writing and executing file permissions are set on 3 levels: user, group and other
rwx permissions are set with octal notation, count 1-7 and start over at 10, 10-17, 20-27
read: 4
write: 2
execute: 1
add numbers together for each group to set permissions numerically
777 gives full permissions to all groups.

# Processes
A process is an instance of a running program. Can run multiple instances of one program. 
Job: a process started from your console
pause process - can restart later
quit or kill process - end permanently

# Pipes and Redirection

UNIX: lots of simple programs and commands that can be piped together to do powerful things
